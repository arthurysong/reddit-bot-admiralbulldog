first, create a database?

so the script just stays running...

that means like every 24 hours we should update the available emotes in the script?
or for every submission / comment we make API calls?

we'll create a Redis
w emote name => pointing to emote URL in BTTV cdn

every 24 hours we'll have a script run that update Redis db w any emotes...

TODO Catch any connection exceptions and handle by reconnecting to praw
TODO update the Redis every 24 hours.
