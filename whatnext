TODO get twitch tv global emotes as well??
TODO add playsounds?

t2.micro 0.555 GiB is enough for elasticache..
recreate the elasticache with no read replicas. it's too expensive for me to have reeplicas :P

TODO fetch all 10,000 emotes from BTTV not just the first 100, it's only a 100 api calls that happen once a day so it's not too bad.

`python3 main.py &` to run the script in background 
`ps ax | grep main.py` to see running main.py process

TODO use deployed Redis
TODO also use normalized comment body for parsing ronnie coleman :D
TODO call it sadgebot?
TODO add source and suggestions page?

first, create a database?

so the script just stays running...

that means like every 24 hours we should update the available emotes in the script?
or for every submission / comment we make API calls?

we'll create a Redis
w emote name => pointing to emote URL in BTTV cdn

every 24 hours we'll have a script run that update Redis db w any emotes...

TODO Catch any connection exceptions and handle by reconnecting to praw
TODO update the Redis every 24 hours.
